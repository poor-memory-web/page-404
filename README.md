<h3>Site responsived just with Media. nothing more</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    You can see the site in this <a href="https://poor-memory-web.github.io/page-404/">Link</a>

<hr>

    The project has tried to use only <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" alt="HTML"> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white" alt="CSS">. <br>
    But a small amount of <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E" alt="JavaScript"> has also been used to help make the project responsive. (If you don't know it, ignore it)
